#	This may be a bit much, but leaving here for now.
#gem 'rails', '~> 3'
#gem 'activerecord', '~> 3'
#gem 'actionpack', '~> 3'

#	2.1.0 doesn't seem to actually start
#gem 'sunspot', '= 2.0.0'
gem 'sunspot_rails', '= 2.0.0'
gem 'sunspot_solr', '= 2.0.0' # optional pre-packaged Solr distribution for use in development
gem 'progress_bar'


#	A bit confused.  In an app, if I were to specify the above in the Gemfile, Sunspot 
#	will be defined.  However, when the Gemfile has a gem which requires sunspot, 
#	Sunspot is NOT defined.  require 'sunspot_rails' must be explicitly called?
#	Perhaps a Railtie should be used?
